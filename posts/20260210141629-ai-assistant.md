It is not rare today to see a lot of people delegating their tasks to AI assistants. Don’t get me wrong, I also use it for a lot of things. I use AI to help me write code, help me review for the first time, so I just review the final steps, not nitpicking unnecessary typos or silly mistakes.

On social media like Twitter — and I still and will always call it Twitter instead of X — I see a lot of writing that is probably AI-generated. Or some of my friends say they let AI write a blog. Again, don’t get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with that, but for me, writing opinions, writing technical blogs, or any kind of personal experience is best if you write it yourself. I still use AI for type checking like grammar and spelling, but the content, the words, the structure are purely from my mind.

Because when I write a blog, I always think again, because only I probably know what I want to say. If I just put some notes to AI and let AI decide what to write, I can’t relate to it, because my blog is my diary. Do you really want others to write your own diary?

I think writing a blog — a personal blog — is different from AI-generated code. With AI-generated code, as long as it is readable and works as expected, we can just say LGTM. But for a personal blog? I don’t know, everyone has a different take on this. But at least for me, when a lot of things can be delegated to AI, I still want to write it myself for my personal blog.
